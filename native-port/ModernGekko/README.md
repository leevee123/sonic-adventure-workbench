# ModernGekko

A runtime for GameCube/Wii recomps.

## Code mods

The runner loads code mods from `Mods` beside the executable and from `<user-dir>/Mods` by default. It accepts package directories named `<id>.mgm` containing `mod.so`, `mod.dll`, or `mod.dylib`, and development libraries named `<id>.mgm.so`, `<id>.mgm.dll`, or `<id>.mgm.dylib`. Use `--mods <directory>` for another location or `--no-mods` to disable loading.

The mod ABI supports dependency ordering, minimum versions, optional dependencies, imports and exports, entry and return hooks, normal and forced function patches, events and callbacks, load callbacks, and exact disc/CPU ABI validation. Netplay fingerprints include every loaded package binary and its filename.

DolRecomp's optional MAP input emits named address constants for code mods. Literal addresses remain supported when a game has no MAP file. See `mod-template` for a minimal package.
